**Research focus (≤90 words):**  
I develop optimization-based control and state-estimation methods—MPC with control-barrier guarantees and adaptive disturbance modeling—to keep robots safe and effective in uncertain, human environments. My work integrates planning, control, and perception through reproducible pipelines from simulation → bench → hardware.

**Highlights**
- UR10e wave-mimic testbed for hardware-in-the-loop disturbance studies  
- 3-D palm-canopy meshing workflow (stereo vs depth; vertex density bench)  
- Consensus-driven adaptive signal control (↓ wait time 57%, ↓ max delay 53%)
