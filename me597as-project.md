**Instructor:** Prof. [Name]   **Term:** Spring 2025  
**Project:** “Constraint-Aware Path Tracking with CBF-MPC”  

---

## Overview
Developed a real-time path-tracking controller combining Control Barrier Functions and Model Predictive Control for collision-free navigation.

---

## Methodology
- Formulated CBF constraints for static obstacles.  
- Implemented MPC in Python with CasADi solver.  
- Validated using ROS Gazebo differential-drive model.

---

## Results
> Maintained safety margin > 0.2 m under variable disturbances.  
Include plots of position error and constraint satisfaction.

---

## Reflection
Insights on computational trade-offs and future extensions.
