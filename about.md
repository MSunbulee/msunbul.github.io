I’m a second-year M.S. student in Robotics at Purdue University and a faculty member (on leave) at KFUPM. I work on safe motion for autonomous systems—integrating planning, control, and perception with formal safety guarantees. My PhD goal is to advance constraint-aware, adaptive autonomy validated from simulation → bench → field.
