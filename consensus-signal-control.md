## Abstract / Overview
Summarize the control approach, objectives, and quantitative impact (e.g., reduction in delay, waiting time).

---

## 1. Introduction
- Urban-traffic context and control limitations  
- Goals of adaptive, consensus-based coordination  

---

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Network & Model Setup  
### 2.2 Consensus Algorithm  
### 2.3 Simulation Environment  

---

## 3. Results
Key metrics, comparisons, and visuals.  
> *57.1 % reduction in average waiting time; 53.3 % reduction in worst-case delay.*

---

## 4. Discussion
Interpret performance, robustness, and scalability.

---

## 5. Conclusion
Main findings and follow-up directions.
