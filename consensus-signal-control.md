## Abstract / Overview
This study introduces a **hybrid two-layer signal control architecture** that integrates **localized consensus-based communication** with **centralized adaptive phase selection** to manage intersections efficiently under mixed traffic conditions.  
The approach employs a **front-priority weighted average consensus algorithm**, emphasizing vehicles nearest to intersections to enhance responsiveness. Structured through an **Extended Chain topology**, it eliminates communication bottlenecks while maintaining constant message load regardless of traffic density.  
Simulations demonstrate a **57.1% reduction in average waiting time** and a **53.3% reduction in worst-case delay**, validating the method‚Äôs scalability and robustness across 100 one-hour runs.

## 1. Introduction
Urban intersections suffer from inefficiencies in traditional centralized signal systems that rely on static timing and global observability. As cities transition to **mixed traffic**‚Äîcombining human-driven, connected, and automated vehicles‚Äîsignal control must adapt to uncertainty and limited connectivity.  
This work addresses these challenges through a **decentralized, scalable coordination framework**, bridging data-driven consensus algorithms with adaptive traffic control logic.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Architecture
The proposed system features two cooperative layers:
1. **Distributed Consensus Layer:** Connected vehicles share queue and delay data through neighbor-to-neighbor communication governed by topology.  
2. **Adaptive Control Layer:** A central controller uses the aggregated consensus information to determine signal phases and green durations based on real-time demand.

This design achieves near-optimal control with constant computational and communication cost, even as vehicle count scales.

### 2.2 Consensus Algorithms
Four algorithmic families were evaluated:
- **Average Consensus** ‚Äî smooth convergence and delay minimization.  
- **Max-Consensus (FloodMax)** ‚Äî high throughput but fairness trade-offs.  
- **Event-Triggered Consensus** ‚Äî efficient under bandwidth limits.  
- **Front-Priority Weighted Consensus** ‚Äî prioritizes front vehicles to improve responsiveness.  

### 2.3 Communication Topologies
Four topologies were tested:
- **Centralized (Global Info)** ‚Äî ideal reference model.  
- **Chain** ‚Äî local V2V communication within each lane.  
- **Chain + Front Priority** ‚Äî adds weighted messaging from front vehicles.  
- **Extended Chain** ‚Äî introduces cross-links among leading vehicles, enabling rapid, low-latency updates across directions.

<p style="text-align:center; margin-top:8px;"><em>Figures 1‚Äì4. Comparison of topologies and consensus variants across performance metrics.</em></p>

**Quantitative Highlights:**
- **Average Consensus + Extended Chain:**  
  - ‚Üì 57.1 % average waiting time  
  - ‚Üì 53.3 % maximum waiting time  
  - Constant controller message load (independent of vehicle count)  
- **Max-Consensus + Centralized:** +8.9 % throughput, but +58.9 % waiting time (delay-throughput trade-off)  
- **Event-Triggered + Chain:** Balanced performance with minimal communication (‚âà 159 msgs/hr)  

The Extended Chain topology consistently achieved the best mean and variance‚Äî**5.96 ¬± 0.19 s** average delay vs. **13.9 ¬± 0.64 s** baseline.

## 4. Discussion
This work demonstrates that **structured partial connectivity** can outperform full observability by filtering only spatially relevant information.  
The Extended Chain topology leverages **front-vehicle awareness**, providing real-time responsiveness with bounded message complexity.  
Event-triggered strategies, though less optimal in absolute delay, offer **superior bandwidth efficiency**, making them ideal for low-infrastructure deployments.  
These insights support a scalable migration path toward **decentralized, communication-efficient smart intersections**.

## 5. Conclusion
The **Consensus-Driven Adaptive Signal Control** framework merges distributed intelligence with centralized adaptivity to address scalability, fairness, and responsiveness.  
By combining **Average Consensus** algorithms with **spatially structured topologies**, it achieves superior delay reduction and stable operation under realistic communication constraints.  
This architecture provides a practical blueprint for the next generation of **connected-vehicle traffic management systems**.
