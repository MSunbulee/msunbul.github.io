## Abstract / Overview
At Purdue‚Äôs **MARS Lab** under **Prof. Yu She**, I contributed to the **Underwater Gladiator** project ‚Äî an autonomous underwater vehicle (**AUV**) designed to operate in two distinct modes:  
1. **Conventional propulsion (submarine mode)** for direct thrust and maneuvering, and  
2. **Energy-efficient gliding mode**, driven by **dynamic buoyancy and mass-distribution control**.

My work focused on **mechanical design and ROS 2 integration**, developing and validating a glider mechanism capable of adjusting its **pitch** and **submerged velocity** through coordinated **mass-shifting** and **water-tank regulation**.

---

## 1. Introduction
Underwater exploration vehicles face a trade-off between **endurance** and **maneuverability**.  
Traditional AUVs rely on thrusters for agility but consume significant energy.  
Gliders, conversely, achieve high endurance via buoyancy-driven motion yet lack rapid control authority.  

The **Underwater Gladiator** merges these paradigms by integrating **thruster-based propulsion** and **glider-based buoyancy control**, enabling adaptive operation across a range of underwater missions.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Mechanical Design
- **Dual-mode structure:** combines a primary thruster with a controllable buoyancy engine.  
- **Variable-mass subsystem:** internal movable weight for precise pitch and trim adjustment.  
- **Water-tank subsystem:** pumps regulate fluid volume to alter density and control ascent/descent rate.  
- Modular layout for easy maintenance and sensor integration.

### 2.2 Simulation & Control
- Modeled the full hydrodynamic dynamics in **ROS 2 / Gazebo**, including drag, ballast shift, and thrust forces.  
- Implemented two controllable DOFs:  
  1. **Linear propulsion (thrust)**,  
  2. **Buoyancy regulation (mass + tank control)**.  
- Verified the dynamic response using trajectory and velocity tracking logs.  
- Simulated both **propulsion** and **gliding** modes under realistic drag and water-density conditions.

**Highlights**
- Verified glider-mode dynamics in ROS 2 using buoyancy-driven motion equations.  
- Demonstrated **smooth pitch transitions** between thrust and glide regimes.  
- Showed robust stability under external wave disturbances.  
- Confirmed feasibility of internal mass-shift and buoyancy control prior to prototyping.

## 4. Discussion
Integrating propulsion and buoyancy control introduced complex coupling between **mechanics** and **fluid dynamics**.  
The simulation framework allows testing of adaptive control laws and quantifying **energy-efficiency gains** before hardware implementation.  
This work deepened my expertise in **system-level modeling**, **underwater control design**, and **ROS-based modular development**.

---

## 5. Conclusion
The **Underwater Gladiator AUV** demonstrates a scalable approach to combining **endurance-oriented gliding** with **agile thrust control**.  
My contributions established the **mechanical framework**, **simulation environment**, and **dynamic validation** supporting future field deployments.  
Next, the system will transition toward **embedded buoyancy-actuator integration** and **in-tank validation**.
