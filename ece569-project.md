**Instructor:** Prof. [Name]   **Term:** Spring 2025  
**Project:** “Manipulator Trajectory Planning and Control on UR5 Simulator”  

---

## Overview
Designed a joint-space trajectory planner and PD controller for a 6-DOF UR5 robot arm to follow parametric curves in 3-D space.

---

## Methodology
- Derived DH parameters and Jacobian.  
- Implemented forward / inverse kinematics in Python.  
- Simulated motion in RViz using MoveIt interface.

---

## Results
Trajectory tracking error < 2 mm for smooth paths.  
Add visualization frames or plots.

---

## Reflection
Challenges in singularity handling and velocity limits.
